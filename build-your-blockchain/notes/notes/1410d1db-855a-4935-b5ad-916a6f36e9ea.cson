  # Understanding Mining Difficulty
  
  Probability that a randomly picked hash is valid is very low

  Total possible 64-digit hex num = 10^77
  Total valid hashes = 2 x 10^55
  
  Probability: 2 x 10^55 / 10^77 = small!
  
  less chance to win the lottery
  
  - If you decrease 18 to 1, then the total valid hashes increase, therefore the probability increase
  - That's how you adjust the difficulty.
  
  ## How is mining difficulty calculated?
  
  Adjusted every 2 weeks (2016 blocks)
  
  Difficulty = current tareget / max target
  - **How much harder it is now to mine bitconi compared to what it was**

  - As of December 7, block 498048, the Bitcoin difficulty stands at 1,590,896,927,258. Each hash is effectively a random number between 1 and 2^256â€“1. The difficulty describes the target that the hash must undershoot. **This is similar to throwing darts randomly at a large target. The difficulty describes the size of the bullseye. The smaller the bullseye, the more often you have to throw a dart to randomly hit the bullseye.**
